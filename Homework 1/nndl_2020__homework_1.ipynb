Learning hyperparameters should be tuned using appropriate search procedures, and final accuracy should be evaluated using a cross-validation setup. For the image classification task, you can also implement more advanced convolutional architectures and explore feature visualization techniques to better understand how the deep network is encoding information at different processing layers.\n"
